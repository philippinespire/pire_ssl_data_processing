Following the [pire_ssl_data_processing](https://github.com/philippinespire/pire_ssl_data_processing) roadmap 

and [pire_fq_gz_processing](https://github.com/philippinespire/pire_fq_gz_processing)

## Step 1. Fastqc

Ran the [Multi_FASTQC.sh](https://github.com/philippinespire/pire_fq_gz_processing/blob/main/Multi_FASTQC.sh) script. [Report](https://github.com/philippinespire/pire_ssl_data_processing/blob/main/herklotsichthys_quadrimaculatus/Multi_FASTQC/multiqc_report_fq.gz.html) Download to view

Potential issues:  
* % duplication - not bad
  * 29s-38s
* gc content - reasonable
  * 46-51%
* quality - good
  * sequence quality and per sequence qual both good
* % adapter - good and low
  * ~2s
* number of reads - good
  * ~216M


## Step 2.  1st fastp

Used [runFASTP_1st_trim.sbatch](https://github.com/philippinespire/pire_fq_gz_processing/blob/main/runFASTP_1st_trim.sbatch)
to generate this [report](https://github.com/philippinespire/pire_ssl_data_processing/blob/main/spratelloides_gracilis/fq_fp1/1st_fastp_report.html)

Jem couldn't generate multiqc report
Potential issues:  
* % duplication - not bad 
  * 31-46%
* gc content - reasonable
  * ~44%
  * more variable in pos 1-72 than in 73-150 
* passing filter - good
  * ~91%
* % adapter - not too bad 
  * 6-7.5%
* number of reads - good
  * ~340-414M

```
cd /home/e1garcia/shotgun_PIRE/pire_ssl_data_processing/herklotsichthys_quadrimaculatus/shotgun_raw_fq
#runFASTP_1.sbatch <indir> <outdir>
# do not use trailing / in paths
sbatch /home/e1garcia/shotgun_PIRE/pire_fq_gz_processing/runFASTP_1st_trim.sbatch "." "../fq_fp1"
```

Multiqc was ran seperately bc it was not working as set up in the runFASTP_1st_trim.sbatch.
 Other users, except for Eric, were automatically loading different versions of dependencies.

log for multiqc: mqc_fastp1-JOBID.out

Long-term solution:
added `module load multiqc` and run multiqc with `srun crun multiqc ....` in the runFASTP_1st_trim.sbatch script


---

## Step 3. Clumpify

Ran [runCLUMPIFY_r1r2_array.bash](https://github.com/philippinespire/pire_fq_gz_processing/blob/main/runCLUMPIFY_r1r2_array.bash) in a 3 node array in Wahab

```
cd /home/e1garcia/shotgun_PIRE/pire_ssl_data_processing/herklotsichthys_quadrimaculatus
bash /home/e1garcia/shotgun_PIRE/pire_fq_gz_processing/runCLUMPIFY_r1r2_array.bash fq_fp1 fq_fp1_clmparray /scratch/e1garcia 3
```

Out files were moved to the `logs` dir

---

## Step 4. Run fastp2


```
cd /home/cbird/pire_cssl_data_processing/leiognathus_leuciscus
#runFASTP_2.sbatch <indir> <outdir> 
# do not use trailing / in paths
sbatch ../scripts/runFASTP_2.sbatch fq_fp1_clmp fq_fp1_clmp_fp2
```

[Report](https://github.com/philippinespire/pire_cssl_data_processing/blob/main/leiognathus_leuciscus/fq_fp1_clmp_fp2/2nd_fastp_report_2.html), download and open in web browser

Potential issues:  
* % duplication - good  
  * alb:20s, contemp: 20s
* gc content - reasonable
  * alb: 40s, contemp: 40s 
* passing filter - good
  * alb: 90s, contemp: 90s 
* % adapter - good
  * alb: 2s, contemp: 2s
* number of reads - lost alot for albatross
  * generally more for albatross than contemp, as we attempted to do
  * alb: 7 mil, contemp: YY mil

## Step 4. Run fastq_screen

I edited runFQSCRN_6* to run on wahab.

```
cd /home/cbird/pire_cssl_data_processing/leiognathus_leuciscus

#runFQSCRN_6.bash <indir> <outdir> <number of nodes to run simultaneously>
# do not use trailing / in paths
bash ../scripts/runFQSCRN_6.bash fq_fp1_clmp_fp2 fq_fp1_clmp_fp2_fqscrn 20

# check output for errors
grep 'error' slurm-fqscrn.266713*out | less -S
grep 'No reads in' slurm-fqscrn.266713*out | less -S
```

[Report](https://github.com/philippinespire/pire_cssl_data_processing/blob/main/leiognathus_leuciscus/fq_fp1_clmp_fp2_fqscrn/fqscrn_report_1.html), download and open in web browser

Potential issues:
* job 9 failed
  * [out file](./logs/LlA01005_CKDL210012719-1a-AK6260-7UDI308_HF5TCDSX2_L1_clmp_fp2_r2.fq.gz)
  * "No reads in LlA01005_CKDL210012719-1a-AK6260-7UDI308_HF5TCDSX2_L1_clmp_fp2_r2.fq.gz, skipping" 
  * I checked this file, there are plenty of reads


Fix errors: all I had to do was run the files again that returned the "No reads in" error and they worked fine

```
cd /home/cbird/pire_cssl_data_processing/leiognathus_leuciscus
#runFQSCRN_6.bash <indir> <outdir> <number of nodes to run simultaneously> <fq file pattern to process>
# do not use trailing / in paths
bash ../scripts/runFQSCRN_6.bash fq_fp1_clmp_fp2 fq_fp1_clmp_fp2_fqscrn 1 LlA01010*r1.fq.gz
bash ../scripts/runFQSCRN_6.bash fq_fp1_clmp_fp2 fq_fp1_clmp_fp2_fqscrn 1 LlA01005*r2.fq.gz
```


Cleanup logs
```
mkdir logs
mv *out logs
```

---

## Step 5. Repair fastq_screen paired end files

This went smoothly.

```
cd /home/cbird/pire_cssl_data_processing/leiognathus_leuciscus
# runREPAIR.sbatch <indir> <outdir> <threads>
sbatch ../scripts/runREPAIR.sbatch fq_fp1_clmp_fp2_fqscrn fq_fp1_clmp_fp2_fqscrn_repaired 40
```
