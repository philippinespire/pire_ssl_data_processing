After de novo assembly, we decided to move forward using SPADES.
In addition, we also noted that assembling contaminated data produced better results for nDNA and decontaminated was better for mtDNA
The effect on mergind reads was unclear

Here, I ran 4 treatments: 
(1) contaminated with merging
(2) contaminated with NO merging
(3) decontaminated with merging
(4) decontaminated with NO merging

FQ directories:
fq_fp1_clmparray_fp2				# contam, no merged
fq_fp1_clmparray_fp2_mrgd			# cotam, with mrgd (reran the whole fp2 step)
fq_fp1_clmparray_fp2_Onlymrgd			# cotam, with mrgd (reran only the mrgd flag from fq_fp1_clmparray_fp2)
fq_fp1_clmparray_fp2_fqscrn_repaired		# decontam, no mrgd
fq_fp1_clmparray_fp2_fqscrn_repaired_Onlymrgd	# decontam with mrgd (reran only the mrgd flag from fq_fp1_clmparray_fp2_fqscrn_repaired)

Assembly directories:
SPAdes						# contam, no merged
SPAdes_R1R2_noIsolate_contam_NOmrgd		# contam, same as SPAdes (forgot to actually include the merged files)
SPAdes_R1R2_noIsolate_contam_mrgd		# cotam, with mrgd. (filters were repeated twice. in theory it shouldn't matter)
SPAdes_R1R2_noIsolate_decontam			# decontam, no mrgd
SPAdes_R1R2_noIsolate_decontam_Onlymrgd		# decontam with mrgd

Results:contam vs decontam
contam vs decontam assemblies were very similar, although Contam assemblies were larger but showed higher L50,and Decontam had lower N50s. 
This was a small differences that I don't think will make a difference but still ran both since Cotanm is better for nDNA and Decontam is better for mtDNA

Results: R1R2 vs R1R2MRDG
both treatments worked only for the decontam data. MRDG assemblies were sligthly worse
MRDG did not work for contam. Due to time limitations (NSF RVS soon), I am skipping redoing treatments.

***CONCLUSION***
***Recommending running contam and decontam but skipping MRDG all together***
