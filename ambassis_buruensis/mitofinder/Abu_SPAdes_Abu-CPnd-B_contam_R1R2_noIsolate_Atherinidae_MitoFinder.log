WARNING : rrnS has been found more than once (2) in the different mitochondrial contigs.
Mitofinder selected the longest sequence as the final sequence.

## Final sequence saved to /home/e1garcia/shotgun_PIRE/pire_ssl_data_processing/ambassis_buruensis/mitofinder/Abu_SPAdes_Abu-CPnd-B_contam_R1R2_noIsolate_Atherinidae/Abu_SPAdes_Abu-CPnd-B_contam_R1R2_noIsolate_Atherinidae_MitoFinder_mitfi_Final_Results/


/!\ WARNING /!\ 1 gene was found more than once suggesting either fragmentation, NUMT annotations, or potential contamination of your sequencing data.
Different contigs may be part of different organisms thus "Abu_SPAdes_Abu-CPnd-B_contam_R1R2_noIsolate_Atherinidae_final_genes_NT.fasta" and "Abu_SPAdes_Abu-CPnd-B_contam_R1R2_noIsolate_Atherinidae_final_genes_AA.fasta" could be erroneous.
We recommend to check contigs and associated genes separately.
