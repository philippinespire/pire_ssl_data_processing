  You are loading a legacy samtools module, please load a up to date module
instead:
  
    module load container_env samtools
  
  Please run samtools command with "crun.samtools" prepend to it, for example:
  
    crun.samtools samtools
  
  Otherwise you will get "command not found" error. 
  You are loading a legacy bedtools module, please load a up to date module
instead:
  
    module load container_env bedtools
  
  Please run bedtools command with "crun.bedtools" prepend to it, for example:
  
    crun.bedtools bedtools
  
  Otherwise you will get "command not found" error.
