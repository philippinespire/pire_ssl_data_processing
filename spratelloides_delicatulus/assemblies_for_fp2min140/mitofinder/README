Eric Created this README

All the MitoFinder results are in:
~/shotgun_PIRE/pire_ssl_data_processing/spratelloides_delicatulus/assemblies_for_fp2min140/mitofinder/Sde_SPAdes_allLibs_decontam_R1R2_noIsolate_spratelloides_delicatulus/Sde_SPAdes_allLibs_decontam_R1R2_noIsolate_spratelloides_delicatulus_MitoFinder_mitfi_Final_Results

Yet, I copied the complete fasta for contig_1, the work that worked, the Sde-CMat_061_mtGenome.fasta, hhere.

So, MitoFinder was able to find pretty much the whole mtGenome:
 (16588bp found by MitoFinder/16617bp in Sde mtGenome in GenBank)
