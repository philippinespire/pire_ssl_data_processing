/!\ WARNING /!\ 15 genes were found more than once suggesting either fragmentation, NUMT annotations, or potential contamination of your sequencing data.
Different contigs may be part of different organisms thus "Pli_SPAdes_allLibs_contam_R1R2_noIsolate_Plotosidae_final_genes_NT.fasta" and "Pli_SPAdes_allLibs_contam_R1R2_noIsolate_Plotosidae_final_genes_AA.fasta" could be erroneous.
We recommend to check contigs and associated genes separately.
