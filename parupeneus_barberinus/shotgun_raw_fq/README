The ssl data are back and can be found on the TAMUCC HPC at /work/hobi/webshare/20230123_PIRE-Pbb-ssl or at https://gridftp.tamucc.edu/genomics/20230123_PIRE-Pbb-ssl/ The sequence name decode sheet is in with the data.
Note there is an updated naming scheme that is formatted as Extraction_id-LibraryPlateWell-LibraryType-Library_id-SeqRun. Extraction_ID is the sample name and extraction from the Extraction database, LibraryPlateWell is the well that the library was processed in. LibraryType is ssl, cssl, or lcwgs. Library_id refers to which library was used (sometimes there were multiple libraries made for an individual). SeqRun is the number of times that individual has been sequenced for this library type.

All 2 library sets are from the same individual Pbb-CGal_008-Ex1
