# *Halichoeres miniatus* log
***

The purpose of this log is to create replicable steps for de novo genome assembly of *H. miniatus* as outlined by Dr. Eric Garcia in the [PIRE Shotgun Data Processing and Analysis Page](github.com/philippinespire/pire_ssl_data_processing) of the [PhilippinesPIRE](github.com/philippinespire) repository.
***

I cloned the repository, copied the data and followed all steps up to line 124 of the instructions on the [PIRE Shotgun Data Processing and Analysis Page](github.com/philippinespire/pire_ssl_data_processing).  I created a README in the *Halichoeres miniatus* directory.  I created this log.
