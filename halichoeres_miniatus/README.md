# *Halichoeres miniatus*
***

The purpose of this repository is to provide replicable steps for de novo genome assembly of *H. miniatus* as outlined by Dr. Eric Garcia in the [PIRE Shotgun Data Processing and Analysis Page](https://github.com/philippinespire/pire_ssl_data_processing) of the [PhilippinesPIRE](https://github.com/philippinespire) repository.  All scripts and software used are explained on the PIRE Shotgun repository.  All bioinformatic work was performed on the Old Dominion University High Performance Computing Cluster.

The documents in this repository are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links).

All work is done for the [Philippines PIRE Project](https://sites.wp.odu.edu/PIRE/), [NSF Award #1743711](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1743711).

See documentation for the Old Dominion University [High Performance Computing](https://www.odu.edu/facultystaff/research/resources/computing/high-performance-computing/user-documentation).

A complete log of all work can be found in the [README.md](https://github.com/philippinespire/pire_ssl_data_processing/tree/main/halichoeres_miniatus/logs) of this repository's subdirectory logs.
